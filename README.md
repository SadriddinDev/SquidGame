- If you reach the finish line in time: ✅ **You win!**

## 🧠 Game Logic Highlights

- **Randomized doll behavior**: The doll turns around at unpredictable times, making gameplay exciting.
- **Dynamic player speed**: Your movement speed adjusts based on your position — giving a fair 80–90% chance of winning if you play carefully.
- **Sound effects**: Enhance tension and immersion during gameplay.
- **Doll's timing cue with song**: The doll faces backward for a random duration and plays a "koko" song accordingly — longer the doll stays turned, longer the song plays. This signals to the player whether they have more time to move safely or need to hurry up, adding an extra layer of strategy and attention.
